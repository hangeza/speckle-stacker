# Speckle Stacker

**Speckle Stacker** is a C++ application and SMIP (Speckle Masking Image Processing) library designed to reconstruct high-resolution astronomical images from short-exposure video frames. By employing speckle masking techniques, the software mitigates the blurring effects of atmospheric turbulence, enabling astronomical imaging close to the diffraction limit of the optical instrument.

## üìñ Project Overview

This project targets astronomers, astrophotographers, and image processing enthusiasts aiming to enhance ground-based telescope imagery. It processes input video data, applies fft, bispectrum accumulation, phase revovery, windowing and fft back transform resulting in a reconstructed deblurred object image close to the diffraction limit of the telescope without atmospheric distortions, depending on the quality and amount of video frames.

## üî¨ Scientific Background

### What is Speckle Imaging?

Speckle imaging is a high-resolution astronomical technique that involves capturing numerous short-exposure images to "freeze" atmospheric distortions. These images are then processed to reconstruct a deblurred representation of the observed object.  

### Speckle Masking Technique

Speckle masking is a form of speckle interferometry that utilizes the bispectrum (or closure phases) of short-exposure images. By analyzing the statistical properties of speckle patterns, it reconstructs high-resolution images, overcoming limitations imposed by atmospheric turbulence.

## üõ†Ô∏è Build From Source

### Dependencies

- OpenCV (>= 4.x)
- FFTW3 (tested with 3.3.5)
- CMake (>= 3.10)
- C++20-compatible compiler (GCC ‚â• 10 or Clang ‚â• 12)

#### Linux Installation

```bash
sudo apt install libopencv-dev fftw3-dev cmake
```

#### Windows Installation (MinGW64)

- Install `libopencv-dev` (e.g. via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/))
- Install FFTW3 library following instructions from: https://fftw.org/install/windows.html

### Build Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hangeza/speckle-stacker.git
cd speckle-stacker
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

- The CLI executable will be located in `build/bin/smip-cli`
- Library will be under `build/output/lib`

## üß™ CLI Usage

The CLI processes videos or GIFs to reconstruct high-resolution images using speckle masking.

### Reproduce the Example Above

```bash
bin/smip-cli -v -b 32 -p 64 -c r ../data/hu940ani/hu940ani.gif
```

*(Assuming execution from `build` folder)*

### Output

- Sum image
- Power spectrum
- Phase map
- Phase consistency map
- Reconstructed image (grayscale & false color, 16-bit)

Future versions will support exporting to HDF5 and FITS file formats.
